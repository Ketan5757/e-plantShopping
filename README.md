# 🌿 Paradise Nursery - E-Commerce Plant Store

## 📌 Project Overview
During my course, I forked the **E-Plant Shopping** repository and made several enhancements, including adding products, improving checkout functionality, and optimizing UI/UX. This project simulates an online nursery where users can browse plants, add them to the cart, and complete a purchase.
